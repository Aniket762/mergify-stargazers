# Steps to run the project üßë‚Äçüíª
We start with creating a virtual environment. With the initialization of the virtual environment, the installation of the modules becomes easy. 

Let's install the `virtualenv` module

```python
1. python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
```

Once, we have the module install we need to create the environment. Over here, I am naming the environment to be `mergify` you are free to give it whatever you prefer.

```python
2. python3 -m venv mergify
```

When the above command is ran, the virtual environment gets created. Now, we activate the virtual environment

```python
3. source mergify/bin/activate
```

To check the version of python you can run the command

```python
4. which python
```

The project uses Flask as the micro-backend framework for building the backend and establishing the API. Let's install the [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) module.

```python
5. pip3 install flask
```

Once, you have installed the Flask module you are good to go with running the `app.py` file.

```python
6. python3 app.py
```
